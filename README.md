# Pelegram: Reimagining real-time chat. Built with Angular.

Welcome to the Pelegram Messenger project! This is a feature-rich, real-time web chat application inspired by Telegram, built from the ground up with Angular for the frontend and a robust backend (NodeJS/Express with MongoDB). It's been challenging journey bringing this to life, and I'm excited to share it.
