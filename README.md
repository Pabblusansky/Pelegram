# Pelegram: Reimagining real-time chat. Built with Angular.

Welcome to the Pelegram Messenger project! This is a feature-rich, real-time web chat application inspired by Telegram, built from the ground up with Angular for the frontend and a robust backend (NodeJS/Express with MongoDB). It's been challenging journey bringing this to life, and I'm excited to share it.

# ‚ú® Features

Pelegram aims to provide a seamless and engaging chat experience. Here's what's packed in (so far!):

üì± Real-Time Messaging: Instant message delivery and updates powered by Socket.IO.

üë§ User Authentication: Secure registration and login system.

üëÄ Online & Last Seen Status: See when your contacts are online or their last activity.

‚úîÔ∏è Message Status: Track if your messages are sent, delivered, and read.

‚úèÔ∏è Edit & Delete Messages: Easily correct mistakes by editing your messages or remove them entirely.

‚Ü™Ô∏è Message Forwarding: Seamlessly forward messages from one chat to another, keeping the original sender's context.

üí¨ Threaded Replies: Reply to messages with a quote of the original for context. Tap the quote to jump to the original message.

üñºÔ∏è User Profiles & Avatars: Personalize your profile and see others' avatars. Clickable names and avatars to view profiles.

üé® Customizable Themes: Light and Dark mode support for comfortable viewing.

üìú Infinite Scroll / Message History Loading: Smoothly load older messages as you scroll up.

üîç User & Chat Search: Easily find users to start new conversations.

And more to come!

# Deployment Status & Known Limitations
Please be aware of the following limitations in the current deployed version:

    Server Spin-Down (Cold Start): The backend is hosted on Render's free tier. If the server is inactive for 15 minutes, it will "spin down" to conserve resources. The first request to an inactive server (e.g., login or sending a message) may experience a delay of 30-50 seconds while the instance wakes up. Subsequent requests will be fast. This is a characteristic of the free hosting plan.

    Ephemeral Filesystem (Media & Avatars): The current implementation for file uploads (avatars, images, audio) saves files directly to the server's local filesystem. While this works perfectly for local development, hosting platforms like Render use an ephemeral filesystem. This means that all uploaded files will be permanently deleted whenever the server restarts or spins down due to inactivity.

        What this means for you: You can upload and view media, but it may disappear after a short period of time.

        The professional solution (planned as a future enhancement) is to integrate a dedicated object storage service like Cloudinary or AWS S3 to ensure persistent file storage.
# Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Angular (Angular CLI)
- TypeScript
- Socket.IO Client
- SCSS for styling
- RxJS for reactive programming

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Socket.IO Server
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication

**Development Tools:**
- npm
- VS Code
- Git

# üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to run Pelegram on your local machine? The new monorepo structure makes it easier than ever.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18.15.0 or higher (v20.x LTS recommended)
- **npm**: v8 or higher (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB**: A local instance running or a connection string to a cloud instance (like MongoDB Atlas)
- **Angular CLI**: (Optional, but recommended for development) `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pabblusansky/pelegram.git
cd Pelegram
```

## 2. Setup Environment Variables (Backend)

The server requires a `.env` file for configuration, such as your JWT secret key.

- Navigate into the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

- Create a new file named `.env`.

- Open the `.env` file and add the following, replacing the placeholder with your own long, random string:
```env
# Used for signing JSON Web Tokens
SECRET_KEY=your_very_long_and_super_secret_text_here

# Optional: If your MongoDB is not on the default localhost:27017
# MONGO_URI=mongodb://user:password@host:port/database

# Optional: The base URL for constructing full file paths
# BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

- Navigate back to the root project directory:
```bash
cd ..
```

## 3. Install All Dependencies

From the root directory of the project (`Pelegram/`), run the install-all script. This will install dependencies for the root, the client, and the server all at once.

```bash
npm run install-all
```

## 4. Run Everything!

That's it! Now, from the root directory, run the dev script. This will start both the backend server (with nodemon) and the Angular frontend development server simultaneously.

```bash
npm run dev
```

- The backend server will start on http://localhost:3000
- The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:4200

Open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:4200** to start using Pelegram!

## Other Useful Commands

All commands should be run from the root directory.

**Build the frontend for production:**
```bash
npm run build-client
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `client/dist/` directory.

**Run frontend unit tests:**
```bash
# Make sure you are in the client directory for this
cd client
npm test
```
